        <h1 class="about">Hello. So here's my life story: </h1>
        <p class="description">I started out in Biomedical Science with plans to pursue Optometry. I never really considered programming in high school, so I decided to try it out for fun by taking a functional programming course, attending my first hackathon and learning basic HTML and CSS from Team Treehouse. I thought I was passionate about Science but I was even more excited about programming! I decided to make the career switch and spent my free time learning as much as I could. I read blogs daily and followed up with tech news. Currently, I am enrolled in Bitmaker's Web Development Immersive course covering all of web and loving every single second of it! These past months have been one hell of a journey, but I'm glad I took the jump.</p>

        GroceryRunner is a grocery delivery platform to help free up time from dreaded chores. Users can browse through thousands of items and add them to their cart. Then, they simply checkout and select the date and time they would like their delivery.

          <p class="project-description">
            Seat Yourself is a clone of Open Table - a reservation web app that simplifies the process of booking. This was the first group project I worked on during Bitmaker's Web Development course.
            There were so many bugs. Bugs everywhere. The bugs were good though, they helped me develop better debugging skills.
            For this project, I worked on mostly on the backend by setting up the models, business logic and authentication.

            Rainforest is a simplified clone of Amazon and was my first rails project at Bitmaker. Rails was hard to grasp at first, especially understanding MVC and how it all worked together.
            I found the concept of sessions and authentication tricky at first, but after some practice, things started to make sense.

            Carol's CRM is a basic contact manager web app that lets you add contacts, edit and view them. This project was my first web application at Bitmaker (made with Sinatra - simplified Rails) when we were first introduced
            to server requests and databases. This was before we learned Rails, and now I'm very grateful I do not have to manually type in all the GET/POST routes.

            Grocery Buddy was designed for the CGI Imagine Challenge held at CUTC (Business &amp; Technology Conference). It was a web application designed to find the cheapest
            grocery store that supplies all your items within a given radius. This was one of my first designs where I learned interaction design and visual design were not the same thing.
